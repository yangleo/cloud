        Horizon (OpenStack Dashboard)
        =============================
        
        Horizon is a Django-based project aimed at providing a complete OpenStack
        Dashboard along with an extensible framework for building new dashboards
        from reusable components. The ``openstack_dashboard`` module is a reference
        implementation of a Django site that uses the ``horizon`` app to provide
        web-based interactions with the various OpenStack projects.
